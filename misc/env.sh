# This script is copied in to the sandbox/ directory during any sandbox make
# target and is used to create an isolated environment for uzbl-core,
# uzbl-browser and uzbl-tabbed to be run and tested.

# It would be better to use something more flexible like $(dirname $0) but I
# couldn't get to work nicely from the Makefile:
#  - Sourcing file gives $0 == /bin/sh
#  - Executing limits scope of variables too much (even with exporting)
# Maybe we should spawn processes from here with an 'exec' at the end?

# Re-define our home location inside the sandbox dir.
